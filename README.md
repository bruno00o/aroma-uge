# Aroma UGE

Aroma UGE is a web application and a PWA that allows students of the Gustave Eiffel University to:

- See their schedule
- See their friends' schedules
- Share their schedule with people without the app (via a link)
- Add todos (server side)
- (for apprentices) See their apprenticeship schedule

This project was a great opportunity for me to learn about PWA, Vue.js, Express.js and JWT.
